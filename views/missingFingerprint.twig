    <p class="warn">
IndieCert was unable to find a matching fingerprint on your claimed URL
    </p>

    <p class="warn">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: the URI scheme changed from <code>di:</code> to <code>ni:///</code>. If you still use the <code>di:</code> scheme you have to update to the new scheme
    </p>

    <p>
You claimed the identity <code>{{ me|e }}</code>, but we were unable to
find the fingerprint of the certificate you are currently authenticated with
on this page.
    </p>

    <p>
You can easily fix this by placing the following fragment in the
<code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your HTML page:
    </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;link rel="me" href="{{ certFingerprint|e }}"&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <p>
If you also want to use this instance as your IndieAuth provider for relying
parties supporting "Distributed IndieAuth" you can add the following to your
HTML page:
    </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="{{ authorizationEndpoint|e }}"&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <p>
When you are done doing that you can <a href="">reload</a> this page and you should be
redirected to the service that was requesting authentication and be logged in.
