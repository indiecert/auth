        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Why IndieCert?</h3>
        <p>
            I got interested in decentralized authentication systems after working on SAML,
            OpenID, OAuth and ran into <a href="http://webid.info/">WebID</a> and
            <a href="https://indieauth.com">IndieAuth</a>. So I though, I can do something
            similar, but then with client certificates instead of "social" login using
            Twitter and GitHub.
        </p>

        <h3>Why client certificates?</h3>
        <p>
            They always fascinated me. This secure technology is available in almost every
            browser, but no one uses it! Of course, this is due to the difficulty in
            deploying it and browser support for actually generating these beautiful
            client certificates... So it is not perfect, but at least on some browsers and
            mobile devices it works really well.
        </p>

        <h3>Supported Browsers</h3>
        <p>
            So far, it seems that Firefox and Chrom(e)(ium) work really well, both on the
            desktop and on Android.
        </p>
        <p>
            Safari was tested at some point, but not consistently. It seems Safari supports
            the <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> tag to generate a private key, but it always
            seems to want to download the certificate instead of installing it in Keychain.
            It seems possible to then manually install the certificate though.
        </p>

        <h3>What about Internet Explorer?</h3>
        <p>
            Well... it is possible to get it to work somehow with an ActiveX control or
            so I've read somewhere. So far I haven't investigated it any further... Of
            course it is possible to generate a certificate in Firefox, export it to
            PKCS#12 format and import it the Windows certificate manager. What also works
            is enrolling in Google Chrome on Windows and after that use Internet Explorer,
            Google Chrome will actually install the certificate in Windows.
        </p>

        <h3>And my iDevice?</h3>
        <p>
            Well. It seems the easiest is to generate a certificate using Firefox and
            exporting it to PKCS#12 and then import it on your iDevice. As
            far as I know Safari on iOS does not support <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> at
            all, but I don't have an iDevice to test with, so it remains speculation.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I specify a URL instead of a domain?</h3>
        <p>
            You can do both. The IndieCert service will follow your URL or domain by
            performing a HTTPS request, follow the redirects and determine the 'effective'
            URL to extract the fingerprints. If you specify <code>example.org</code>
            IndieCert will try to fetch <code>https://example.org/</code> and possibly
            follow any redirects. You can also specify a full URL, e.g.:
            <code>https://www.example.org/johndoe/</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Is this the end game?</h3>
        <p>
            No. It is an intermediate step towards better browser authentication. See for
            example <a href="http://browserauth.net/">http://browserauth.net/</a> for more
            discussion on the topic. IndieCert (partly) solves some of the issues presented
            there.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I need a HTTPS home page?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. In order to be sure that your client certificate and your identity
            expressed by the URL you claim are bound you need to make the URL available
            over HTTPS. It can <strong>NOT</strong> be a self signed certificate. It must
            be signed by a "trusted" CA. You can use
            <a href="https://startssl.com/">StartSSL</a> to obtain a free certificate or
            wait for <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letâ€™s Encrypt</a>. For now also
            the <a href="http://www.cacert.org">CAcert</a> CA is supported.
        </p>

        <h3>Supported Services</h3>
        <p>
            There is a "Distributed IndieAuth" demo
            <a href="https://www.tuxed.net/distributed-indieauth-demo/">here</a>. It checks
            the <code>authorization_endpoint</code> on your home page and uses the
            service mentioned there. If it is not set
            <code>https://indiecert.net/auth</code> will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            A list of sites that support "Distributed IndieAuth" can also be found on the
            <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/distributed-indieauth#Sites_that_support_distributed_IndieAuth">IndieWebCamp</a> wiki.
        </p>

        <h3>Fingerprints?</h3>
        <p>
            You need to place the fingerprint of the certificate that was installed in your
            browser on your home page. You can add multiple fingerprints to your home page
            for multiple browsers and/or devices. IndieCert will help you by showing the
            fingerprint to put on your home page if it is not (yet) there when you try to
            authenticate.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fingerprint of the certificate is generated by calculating the SHA-256 hash
            over the DER encoded certificate and base64url encoding the resulting binary
            string according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920">RFC 6920</a>
            "Naming Things with Hashes" and
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5">RFC 4648</a>
            "The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings". For example:
        </p>

<blockquote>

&lt;link rel="me" href="ni:///sha-256;ThIaJ7TJQ1oAIKCGKe0BdBO3Bh8NzxZeyAa-WCTuzpU?ct=application/x-x509-user-cert"&gt;
</pre>

        <h3>How can I become a relying party?</h3>
        <p>
            See the relying party instructions <a href="rp">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>How secure is this?</h3>
        <p>
            What happens in case the IndieCert instance you are using is
            compromised.
        </p>
        <h4>"Distributed IndieAuth"</h4>
        <p>
            In case you are using this instance as "Distributed IndieAuth"
            endpoint, by specifying this instance in
            <code>authorization_endpoint</code> on your home page, all relying
            parties that use "Distributed IndieAuth" will be vulnerable to
            impersonation of your account by the attacker.
        </p>

        <h4>As Default Server</h4>
        <p>
            If a relying party uses this instance as the default, without
            supporting "Distributed IndieAuth", all accounts are vulnerable at
            the relying party.
        </p>

        <h4>Certificates</h4>
        <p>
            The client certificate's private key installed in the user's
            browser cannot be compromised by a compromised IndieCert instance,
            so it can still be used later on when the service recovers or the
            user decides to trust another instance.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I run my own instance?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! This is one of the design principles that it is easy to run your own
            instance of IndieCert. You can find the code and installation instructions in
            the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fkooman/indiecert">repository</a>. RPMs
            are available for CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora. You can also run
            a Docker
            <a href="https://github.com/fkooman/indiecert/tree/master/docker">instance</a>,
            ideal for testing while developing your relying party!
        </p>

        <h3>Where can I get more information?</h3>
        <p>
            You can read this <a href="https://www.tuxed.net/fkooman/blog/indiecert.html">blog</a> entry.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I help or get help?</h3>
        <p>
            Test it out on as many browsers and devices possible and create issues on
            <a href="https://github.com/fkooman/indiecert/issues">GitHub</a>, and if you
            can patches to get Safari to work better, IE at all and come up with solutions
            for iDevices :-)
