    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>Why IndieCert?</h3>
    <p>
        I wanted to add a decentralized authentication mechanism to IndieAuth. 
        Depending on <em>cloud-services</em> for authentication seemed wrong.
    </p>

    <h3>Why client certificates?</h3>
    <p>
        Because they are very secure. The UX is horrible though, with this 
        service I try to improve that a bit! You can use any client certificate
        with IndieCert, so if you already have one, e.g. a WebID certificate, 
        feel free to use it! 
    </p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
        Your browser needs to have a client certificate installed and it must
        be used to authenticate to IndieCert. After that, your home page will
        be fetched over HTTPS to check if the fingerprint is mentioned on your
        homepage. If that is true, it means you are successfully authenticated!
    </p>

    <h3>Supported Browsers</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Firefox (Windows, Linux, Android)</li>
        <li>Chromium (Linux)</li>
        <li>Chrome (Windows, Android)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Do I need a HTTPS home page?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes. Use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letâ€™s Encrypt</a> if your 
        home page is not yet available over HTTPS.
    </p>

    <h3 id="supportedServices">Supported Services</h3>
    <p>
        A list of services and sites that support IndieCert is maintained at the
        <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/distributed-indieauth#Sites_that_support_distributed_IndieAuth">IndieWebCamp wiki</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Certificate Fingerprint</h3>
    <p>
        The fingerprint of the certificate is generated by calculating the SHA-256 hash
        over the DER encoded certificate and base64url encoding the resulting binary
        string according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920">RFC 6920</a>
        "Naming Things with Hashes" and
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5">RFC 4648</a>
        "The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings". This is done when you
        try to authenticate to a service and your fingerprint cannot be found
        on your homepage. IndieCert will tell you what to put in your home page
        HTML. You can also generate it using OpenSSL:
    </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
$ openssl x509 -in client.crt -outform DER \
    | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 \
    | openssl base64 \
    | tr +/ -_ \
    | tr -d =
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <h3>Can I become a relying party?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes! See IndieAuth <a href="https://indieauth.com/developers">instructions</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How secure is this?</h3>
    <p>
        If you chose to use this instance of IndieCert and it gets compromised,
        everyone can inpersonate you at the services that support IndieCert.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your client certificate is safe, so it is very easy to switch to a 
        secure alternative.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I run my own instance?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes! This is one of the design principles that it is easy to run your own
        instance of IndieCert. You can find the code and installation instructions in
        the <a href="https://github.com/indiecert/deployment">deployment</a> repository.
    </p>

    <h3>Is IndieCert the end game?</h3>
    <p>
        No. It is an intermediate step towards better browser authentication. See for
        example <a href="http://browserauth.net/">http://browserauth.net/</a> for more
        discussion on the topic. IndieCert (partly) solves some of the issues presented
        there.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I help or get help?</h3>
    <p>
        Test it out on as many browsers and devices possible and create issues on
        <a href="https://github.com/indiecert/auth/issues">GitHub</a>, and if you
        can patches to get Safari to work better, IE at all and come up with solutions
        for iDevices :-)
