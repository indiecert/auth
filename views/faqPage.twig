    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Why IndieCert?</h3>
    <p>
I got interested in decentralized authentication systems after working on SAML,
OpenID, OAuth and ran into <a href="http://webid.info/">WebID</a> and
<a href="https://indieauth.com">IndieAuth</a>. So I though, I can do something
similar, but then with client certificates instead of "social" login using
Twitter and GitHub.
    </p>

    <h3>Why client certificates?</h3>
    <p>
They always fascinated me. This secure technology is available in almost every
browser, but no one uses it! Of course, this is due to the difficulty in
deploying it and browser support for actually generating these beautiful
client certificates... So it is not perfect, but at least on some browsers and
mobile devices it works really well.
    </p>

    <h3>Supported Browsers</h3>
    <p>
So far, it seems that Firefox and Chrom(e)(ium) work really well, both on the
desktop and on Android.
    </p>
    <p>
Safari was tested at some point, but not consistently. It seems Safari supports
the <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> tag to generate a private key, but it always
seems to want to download the certificate instead of installing it in Keychain.
It seems possible to then manually install the certificate though.
    </p>

    <h3>What about Internet Explorer?</h3>
    <p>
Well... it is possible to get it to work somehow with an ActiveX control or
so I've read somewhere. So far I haven't investigated it any further... Of
course it is possible to generate a certificate in Firefox, export it to
PKCS#12 format and import it the Windows certificate manager. What also works
is enrolling in Google Chrome on Windows and after that use Internet Explorer,
Google Chrome will actually install the certificate in Windows.
    </p>

    <h3>And my iDevice?</h3>
    <p>
Well. It seems the easiest is to generate a certificate using Firefox and
exporting it to PKCS#12 and then import it on your iDevice. As
far as I know Safari on iOS does not support <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> at
all, but I don't have an iDevice to test with, so it remains speculation.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I specify a URL instead of a domain?</h3>
    <p>
You can do both. The IndieCert service will follow your URL or domain by
performing a HTTPS request, follow the redirects and determine the 'effective'
URL to extract the fingerprints. If you specify <code>example.org</code>
IndieCert will try to fetch <code>https://example.org/</code> and possibly
follow any redirects. You can also specify a full URL, e.g.:
<code>https://www.example.org/johndoe/</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I need a HTTPS home page?</h3>
    <p>
Yes. In order to be sure that your client certificate and your identity
expressed by the URL you claim are bound you need to make the URL available
over HTTPS. It can <strong>NOT</strong> be a self signed certificate. It must
be signed by a "trusted" CA. You can use
<a href="https://startssl.com/">StartSSL</a> to obtain a free certificate or
wait for <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letâ€™s Encrypt</a>. For now also
the <a href="http://www.cacert.org">CAcert</a> CA is supported.
    </p>

    <h3>Fingerprints?</h3>
    <p>
You need to place the fingerprint of the certificate that was installed in your
browser on your home page. You can add multiple fingerprints to your home page
for multiple browsers and/or devices. IndieCert will help you by showing the
fingerprint to put on your home page if it is not (yet) there when you try to
authenticate.
    </p>
    <p>
The fingerprint of the certificate is generated by calculating the SHA-256 hash
over the DER encoded certificate and base64url encoding the resulting binary
string according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920">RFC 6920</a>
"Naming Things with Hashes" and
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5">RFC 4648</a>
"The Base16, Base32, and Base64 Data Encodings". For example:
    </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;link rel="me" href="ni:///sha-256;ThIaJ7TJQ1oAIKCGKe0BdBO3Bh8NzxZeyAa-WCTuzpU?ct=application/x-x509-user-cert"&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

    <h3>How can I become a relying party?</h3>
    <p>
See the relying party instructions <a href="rp">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>How secure is this? What if the IndieCert server gets compromised?</h3>
    <p>
The worst case scenario is that anyone can claim any identity, so you can take
over someone's account. The idea is for this service to be distributed, running
on different implementations, so the impact of a compromise will be reduced.
Recovery from compromise will require a regeneration of the CA and require all
users to enroll again to the service to generate a new client certificate.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I run my own instance?</h3>
Yes! This is one of the design principles that it is easy to run your own
instance of IndieCert. You can find the code and installation instructions in
the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/fkooman/indiecert">repository</a>. RPMs
are available for CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora. You can also run
a Docker
<a href="https://github.com/fkooman/indiecert/tree/master/docker">instance</a>,
ideal for testing while developing your relying party!
    </p>

    <h3>Where can I get more information?</h3>
    <p>
You can read this <a href="https://www.tuxed.net/fkooman/blog/indiecert.html">blog</a> entry.
    </p>

    <h3>How can I help or get help?</h3>
    <p>
Test it out on as many browsers and devices possible and create issues on
<a href="https://github.com/fkooman/indiecert/issues">GitHub</a>, and if you
can patches to get Safari to work better, IE at all and come up with solutions
for iDevices :-)
    </p>
